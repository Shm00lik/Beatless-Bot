# Beatless-Bot
You can play with this bot a game that I don't remember his name

## How To Play
So basically you need to choose between two colors, (r)ed and (b)lack. These are our cards.

You need to choose three cards, like `r b r` or `b b b`, The bot will also choose three cards.
After that, the bot will **randomly select** three cards. If any of the choices (yours or bot's) is match to the selected cards, the selector will win.

If no one has guessed correct, the bot will add another card. For example, you chose `b r b`, the bot chose `r b b`, and the random cards are `b b r`, the bot will add another random card. Then, the cards will be `b b r b`.\
Because you chose `b r b`, and it in the cards (`b *b r b*`), you win.

### The goal is for the bot to always (or at least for the most part) win

You can run this on your machine, and f you have any problem - Shmoolik#4454 on Discord.
